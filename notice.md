# Notice
The development of BlockJS is currently paused in favor of Cavesiterâ€”a mod that will serve as the "main game" of BlockJS. It will be publicly released around February. Cavesiter will support way more things than BlockJS like improved shaders, more textures, a modding API, SSO auth system, etc. It will be compatible with BlockJS from versions u6 and if you're not using the Cavesiter client, please install the `Cavesiter Core` mod (which is also in the works) to allow Cavesiter to be installed. The source code is currently in the works and expect BlockJS itself to get a better modding API.
